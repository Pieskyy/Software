    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>
      Hi, I’m Adam, and for my software project I chose to create a system based on
      Clash Royale, a game I’ve enjoyed and studied for years. I wanted my project
      to reflect something I’m personally passionate about, and Clash Royale was the perfect choice
      for showcasing both creativity and technical skills.

      <br><br>
      I chose Clash Royale because the game includes a huge variety of cards, stats, rarities, and
      mechanics that translate really well into a software system. It gave me meaningful data to
      work with, from storing card information in databases to designing pages, UI layouts, and
      features based on real game elements.

      <br><br>
      Using Clash Royale also allowed me to demonstrate multiple aspects of software development:
      database design, routing, rendering templates, working with images, and creating a clean and
      interactive interface. Building something based on a game I genuinely enjoy made the entire
      development process more engaging, motivating, and fun.

      <br><br>
      Overall, this project represents both my interest in the game and my growing skills in
      software development.
